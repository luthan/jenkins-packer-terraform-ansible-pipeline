This setup builds a jenkins server and a web server.  when web page changes occur, jenkins will poll the scm
and build a new ami which will then be deployed by terraform

Jenkins will need additional setup (build the pipeline, connect it to scm, and setup polling schedule).  Jenkinsfile contains the
pipeline steps.

Instructions:

First need to create two AMIs, in "first_steps" directory:

packer build jenkins-server.json

packer build web-server.json

initialize terraform and build jenkins server and web server - in terraform directory

make sure you have the proper bucket setup in s3

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply
